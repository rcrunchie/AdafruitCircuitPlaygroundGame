## Game Description
Fill up the circle as each light speeds past,
pressing the button to stop the light in its
place. If you place the light consecutively in
a circle, then you've won that level and
move on to the next round. The light will go
around faster and faster as the level
increases. If you place the light out of order,
you get reset to the first level and have to
start over. You can set the color of the lights
should you wish to.
